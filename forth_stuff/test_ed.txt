tried  using ic here d0 hope it worked
trying out fancy new in2 with one nicer looking line
I do think it would be nice if it worked ykyk
I think it writes on extra characters equal to the number of characters removed from the line
possibly it was that cuz im pretty sure that's some bad memory practice
speaking of bad memory practice and copium I am also going to be on the having one extra 0 at the end was the issue copium for as long as I can as well
I'm gonna be on the not closing the file was the issue copium for as long as I can
it's so much better now that the actual saving bug is fixed lol
it worked?!
