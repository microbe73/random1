retesting i0 one more time
and just making sure I did the right thing with i0
this should be the first line now
test file to not break real ones until I know the editor works
that was hopefully the only issue
maybe not closing the file was the issue?
just making sure the copying didnt not work
line numbers are pretty nice I like them
testing if the new len stuff works on basic features
it would be nice if it worked ykyk
it did not look good oops
but maybe now it looks okay?
possibly it was that cuz im pretty sure that's some bad memory practice
speaking of bad memory practice and copium I am also going to be on the having one extra 0 at the end was the issue copium for as long as I can as well
I'm gonna be on the not closing the file was the issue copium for as long as I can
