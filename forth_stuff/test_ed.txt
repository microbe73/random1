retesting i0 one more time
also just making sure I did the right thing with i0
testing if the new len stuff works on basic features
I do think it would be nice if it worked ykyk
it did not look good oops
but maybe now it looks okay?
possibly it was that cuz im pretty sure that's some bad memory practice
speaking of bad memory practice and copium I am also going to be on the having one extra 0 at the end was the issue copium for as long as I can as well
I'm gonna be on the not closing the file was the issue copium for as long as I can
It was in fact not the not closing the file issue, it would be ideal if I could actually figure out what causes that bug and recreate it consistently
I don't even think it's a length issue I've had this bug even when it was 2d array text storage im pretty sure, tis unfortunate
it was 2d array text storage im pretty sure, tis unfortunate
