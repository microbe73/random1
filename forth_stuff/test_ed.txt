test file to not break real ones until I know the editor works
that was hopefully the only issue
maybe not closing the file was the issue? that def is not good
I think i just needed to increment num-lines maybe
possibly it was that cuz im pretty sure that's some bad memory practice
I'm gonna be on the not closing the file was the issue copium for as long as I can
yooo did that actually work maybe?
