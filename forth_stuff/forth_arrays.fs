( so the plan is to define words for arrays stored in the following way:
len, [0, 1, 2, ...]. I think this is the best way to do like map or filter
or reduce. the ' [word] operator gives the address of a word and then
execute executes it )
: square dup * ;

: map ( op arr -- )
  dup @ 0 u+do
  1 cells + dup @ rot tuck execute rot dup -rot !
  loop drop drop ;

: reduce ( op arr -- num )
  dup @ swap 1 cells + dup @ rot 1 u+do
  swap 1 cells + dup @ 2swap -rot 2tuck execute 2swap nip -rot
  loop nip ;

: positive
  0 > ;

: ccount ( op arr -- op arr num [counts the number of elements in an array that meet a condition] )
  0 swap dup @ 0 u+do
  1 cells + dup @ -rot 2swap swap tuck execute 
  if
    rot 1 + rot
  else
    -rot
  endif
  loop swap ;

: filter ( op arr2 arr1 -- op arr2 arr1 [arr1 is filtered into arr2, run ccount first to find the correct size for arr2] )
  dup @ 0 u+do
  1 cells + swap -rot dup @ rot tuck execute 
  if
    -rot dup @ rot 1 cells + tuck ! swap
  else
    -rot
  endif
  loop
;

: a_op ( op arr1 arr2 arr3 -- op arr1 arr2 arr3 [element wise operation on a1 and a2 like + so that we get a3[i] = a1[i] op a2[i]] ) 
  dup @ 0 u+do
  1 cells + rot 1 cells + rot 1 cells + rot 2swap -rot 2over @ swap @ rot dup 2swap rot execute rot tuck ! -rot swap 2swap
  loop
;

( So for multi dimensional arrays we have an array of pointers. But to tell apart the pointer 40459045 from the number 40459045, arrays of pointers will have negative length numbers )
( On second thought this is a user-side issue only use matrix functions on matrices and array functions on arrays that's why there are different ones, this is probably better )

: m_op ( op matrix1 matrix2 matrix3 -- op matrix1 matrix2 matrix3 [operation can be something like addition or subtraction or any element-wise operation, all matrices must have same size] )
  dup @ 0 u+do
  1 cells + rot 1 cells + rot 1 cells + rot 2dup @ swap @ 2rot 2dup @ -rot 2rot 2rot swap 2swap a_op drop drop drop drop swap 2swap
  loop
;

: switch ( add1 add2 -- add1 add2 ) dup
;
